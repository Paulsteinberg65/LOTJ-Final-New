There are two problems. \n\nThe first is that we need new rules to govern out forest sustainably for the benefit of the community. Right now it's a free-for-all. Everyone is in a race to take what's left from the forest before it is all gone.  \n\nBut after reading widely in the published research, I have made an important discovery: the famous 'tragedy of the commons' is misleading.  According to that theory, property owned in common by large numbers of people is doomed to be overexploited.  But I have learned that many communities around the world have put in place rules to sustainably manage their resources. \n\nWe need new rules and we need them now.  But this leads to the second problem:  Dante and his thugs would do anything to prevent--"];

The rate of species extinction is now more than 100 times higher than the rate prior to the appearance of humans. The most important cause of extinction is habitat destruction, such as the clearing of tropical forests for agriculture. \n\nThe tropics are home to two-thirds of the world’s species, most of which live in forests. Today only half of the original forest cover remains. \n\nOur forest is part of what scientists call the Mesoamerican hotspot. Biodiversity hotspots are species-rich areas facing imminent threats. These areas collectively contain 44% of the world’s plant species and 35% of all vertebrate species. At the current rate of habitat destruction, we will eventually lose about 40% of the species in hotspots throughout the tropics.",

This belief stems from Garrett Hardin’s “tragedy of the commons” argument. In a famous article published in 1968, Hardin claimed that when a resource is shared by many people, self-interest will lead to its overuse and eventual destruction. \n\nHardin was confusing common-property – in which a resource is jointly owned and managed – with open access, where it's every man for himself. Open access sounds an awful lot like our forest lately. I wonder what it takes to make common-property systems work?",

	journalDict[4] = ["Research Journal Entry March 5 \n\nA case study of community forest management in action \n\nThe research literature is filled with examples of communities that have sensible rules for governing local forests. One example is the community of Santa Catarina Ixtepeji, in the Mexican state of Oaxaca. Until 1980, the forests around this small community were under the control of a government-run timber operation.  \n\nIn the 1970s, community members demanded a greater role in forest management and eventually gained control. This occurred as part of a larger trend across Mexico favoring community forestry. The community of Ixtepeji operates a commercial timber mill that markets wood from its 15,000 hectares of production forests, which also produce profitable non-timber products such as white mushrooms and pine resin. Another 4,000 hectares are in restoration and conservation areas to protect biodiversity and water sources.",  
	"\n\nThese activities are profitable! The money supports local services like roads and schools. The community has invested in equipment to sell more profitable processed wood products, while expanding into businesses like nature tourism and bottling local spring water.  \n\nTo ensure a balance between conservation and development, major decisions concerning the forest are made by the community's general assembly in consultation with national environmental officials. Any community member who breaks the rules faces fines or exclusion from community enterprises. Might we create something like this in our community?",

	journalDict[5] = ["Research Journal Entry March 30 \n\nCommunity forestry is growing in importance due to political decentralization \n\nDozens of countries are experimenting with 'decentralization,' giving local governments new powers to decide how natural resources are used. This is important because local governments are often in a better position to identify and meet the needs of local people. I recall reading in the news that lawmakers in our country are debating a proposal along these lines.  \n\nAccording to my research, decentralization has been successful in some places but has caused conflict elsewhere. An example can be found in Senegal, where the forestry code of 1998 supposedly gave local councils new powers to control commercial use of their forests. But the central government didn't want to give up control, and pressured the councils to meet unsustainable production quotas.  \n\nThis shows that we can never ignore the central government when thinking about local management of forests. National policy decisions have an enormous impact on local outcomes.",

	journalDict[6] = ["Research Journal Entry April 14 \n\nWhat exactly is a 'local community' in the context of forest management? \n\nWhen designing rules for local management of forests, we must define what we mean by “local.” Is a man local according to his birthplace, where he lives now, his proximity to the forest boundary, or how much he relies on the forest? My research suggests that different definitions may be needed in different circumstances.  \n\nLocal communities are not homogenous. There is often considerable diversity in race, ethnicity, religion, and economic standing. Research shows that the poor often rely more on forest commons, and may have a special interest in sustaining the forest as a hedge against unemployment. Wealthier and more politically powerful community members may dominate the use of a common resource unless rules are put in place to ensure that everyone has access.  \n\nThat's certainly true of this community. Dante and his men have been intimidating local people and stealing their land. Lately it seems like someone has been following me. I may need to hide out for a couple of days in the cave I discovered at the top of the waterfall.",

	journalDict[7] = ["Research Journal Entry May 4 \n\nWomen's participation is essential in community forestry \n\nI have learned that rural women are among those most seriously affected by deforestation. Healthy forests are necessary for traditional women's activities such as the collection of fuel wood and medicinal plants. Without adequate cooking fuel, they are less likely to boil water used for cooking and cleaning, which can affect the health of entire communities.  \n\nCommunity forestry programs often discriminate against women despite evidence that women’s participation can increase their effectiveness. A case study in India shows that when forest access is limited to men, women must walk long distances to neighboring forests to gather fuel and fodder. Even in villages where women have the right to use the forest, they're often excluded from meetings where decisions are made about the rules governing forest use.",

Some communities have a strong conservation ethic and take a long-term view. Others may be unaware of the long-term impacts of their actions or face strong financial pressures to convert forests to cropland and pasture.  \n\nFor example, in the community of Loma Alta in western Ecuador, most residents wish to clear the land and grow the profitable paja toquilla plant. They see little reason to restrict forest access or reduce short-term profits. In these settings, one promising approach is to put in place rules that allow communities to charge users (such as local water companies) for the environmental benefits provided by forested lands.",
