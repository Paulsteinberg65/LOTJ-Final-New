Due to the destruction of forests throughout their migratory range, ceruleans are the most endangered birds in the eastern United States, with a population shrinking by three percent per year. This is part of a larger trend. Globally, 1,226 bird species - one out of every eight species of bird on planet earth - are threatened with extinction, primarily as a result of habitat destruction."];
	TimberSign = ["This timber was harvested illegally from the nearby national forest. It will be exported to the United States to manufacture furniture. The US has laws against this, but without clear labeling requirements, no one knows which timber was harvested legally in the country of origin."];
	HomeSign = ["This home was built without permits and without the backing of the government. As is common in the developing world, the official process for permitting and registering homes and businesses is so cumbersome that people avoid it altogether. But without legal documentation of their property, people can't use these assets to secure loans for investment and business expansion."];

Democratic reforms introduced in this country several years ago ensure that mayors are now elected directly by the people instead of appointed by the military. \nReflecting a broader trend throughout Latin America, there has been a movement to grant more decision-making power and tax revenues to local governments instead of concentrating authority in the capital. But the process is incomplete, and not all national leaders are comfortable with the idea of handing over power."];

It's our source of food, water, and medicine", "But things have gotten so out of control. Farmers set fires in a race to claim land.", "Remember the hill where you and your friends would play in the trees until dark? It is now a field of ashes.", "The trouble began when a very dangerous man named Dante and his henchmen moved into the area a few years ago and began illegally harvesting the largest trees in the forest.", "The national government has done nothing to stop him. Your father decided to try and put an end to this madness.", "He must have set up camp in the forest. You must find him.
