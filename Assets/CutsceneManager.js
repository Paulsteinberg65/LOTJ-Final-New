		TextDict.push("The cloudy water reduces sunlight, and this means less oxygen for the fish.");
		TextDict.push("I will speak with the other craftspeople.  The artisans are natural allies for conservation because we need sustainable wood supplies.");
		TextDict.push("We also want to be sure that any new rules serve the interests of the local community rather than foreign corporations.");

		TextDict.push("If you want to get people's attention, remember: people listen to others in their peer group, who share their background and concerns.");
